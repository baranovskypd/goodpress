The goal of goodpress is to post to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) from [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
I need this prototype for [a course](https://scientific-rmd-blogging.netlify.app/). ðŸ˜º

**Limitation**: This package relies on the standard WordPress REST API but has only been tested on self-hosted Wordpress installations. It may or may not work with the centralised wordpress.com service (if it does, please report back, for instance in an issue).

**Important disclaimer**: I don't use WordPress, so I am not sure you should trust me.
You are welcome to try out the package (not on important stuff, rather in a playground of some sort), to contribute, and to volunteer to take over this package/concept. If you write a newer and better R package please tell me about it
so I can add a link to it.
