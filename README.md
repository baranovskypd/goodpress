The goal of goodpress is to post to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
from [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). I need this prototype
for [a course](https://scientific-rmd-blogging.netlify.app/). üò∫

**Limitation**: This package works with WordPress REST API and needs
your adding an authentication plugin to your WordPress website. You can
only install plugins on WordPress websites that are either **not** on
wordpress.com (self-hosted; paid service somewhere) or with a costly
wordpress.com business plan.

**Important disclaimer**: I don‚Äôt use WordPress, so I am not sure you
should trust me. You are welcome to try out the package (not on
important stuff, rather in a playground of some sort), to contribute,
and to volunteer to take over this package/concept. If you write a newer
and better R package please tell me about it so I can add a link to it.

## Installation

You can install the released version of goodpress from this repository:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("maelle/goodpress", ref = "main")
```

Then you will need to tweaks things **once** on your website for three
aspects

  - Authentication (this is **compulsory**)
  - Syntax highlighting (if you want to show R code in your posts)
  - Math (if you want to show math in your posts)

See `vignette("setup", package = "goodpress")`.

## Workflow

  - Create your posts in folders, one folder per post, with index.Rmd
    knitted to index.md and figures under a ‚Äúfigs‚Äù folder.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
fs::dir_tree(system.file(file.path("post-example2"), package = "goodpress"))
#> /home/maelle/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.6/goodpress/post-example2
#> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl
#> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ figs
#> ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pressure-1.png
#> ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unnamed-chunk-1-1.png
#> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.Rmd
#> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md
#> ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ refs.bib
```

  - The post index.Rmd should use
    [`hugodown::md_document`](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/reference/md_document.html)
    as an output format.
  - Knit your post and then, run the function `wp_post()` that takes the
    path as argument, create a draft post in your website, uploads all
    image media stored in the ‚Äúfigs‚Äù folder, edits the references to
    image media and then publishes the post.
  - The first time you run `wp_post()` in a folder, it creates a file
    called `.wordpress.yml` that contains, in particular, the URL and ID
    of the post on your WordPress website. This way, next time the
    function is run, the post is *updated*.

[Example post](https://rmd-wordpress.eu/post-rmd/) and [its
source](https://github.com/maelle/goodpress/tree/main/inst/post-example2).
Note that it includes citations as footnotes by using the [same strategy
as hugodown](https://github.com/r-lib/hugodown#citations).

  - The default status of the post is ‚Äúpublish‚Äù. If you want another
    status (status has to be one of: ‚Äúpublish‚Äù, ‚Äúfuture‚Äù, ‚Äúdraft‚Äù,
    ‚Äúpending‚Äù, ‚Äúprivate‚Äù) , write it in the yaml (and then knit
    index.Rmd again) e.g.

<!-- end list -->

``` yaml
---
title: "Title of the Post"
date: "2020-04-01T00:00:00"
slug: "post-slug"
excerpt: "Here I summarize this fantastic post"
status: "private"
output: hugodown::md_document
---
```

The package cannot handle private posts with password, only private
posts that are visible to admins and editors only. You could create a
private post, and then from the WordPress interface make it visible with
password. Make it private again before trying to update the post with
the R package.

The ‚Äúone post per folder‚Äù thing is inspired by Hugo leaf bundles.

On disk your post is stored as index.Rmd and index.md, but before upload
to the WordPress API it is transformed to HTML using
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

## Motivation

The current best tool for writing from R Markdown to WordPress,
[`knitr::knit2wp()`](http://tobiasdienlin.com/2019/03/08/how-to-publish-a-blog-post-on-wordpress-using-rmarkdown/),
relies on a package that hasn‚Äôt been updated in years and that depends
on the no longer recommended
[`RCurl`](https://frie.codes/curl-vs-rcurl/) and `XML`. In the meantime,
WordPress gained a [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/)
that to my knowledge isn‚Äôt wrapped in any [working R
package](https://github.com/jaredlander/wordpressr).

There is also the solution to [use a plug-in to sync a GitHub repo with
a WordPress blog](https://github.com/mAAdhaTTah/wordpress-github-sync/)
(see [this website](https://abcdr.thinkr.fr/soumettre-un-article/) and
[its source](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/abcdR)) but it doesn‚Äôt
handle media. If you use a GitHub repo:

  - You could set up something like a GitHub Action that‚Äôd interact with
    WordPress REST API each time you push to the default branch.
  - Are you still sure you don‚Äôt want to use a [static website generator
    instead](https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/)? :wink: More
    seriously, I am interested in blogging workflows so feel free to
    tell me why you use WordPress (in an issue for instance).
