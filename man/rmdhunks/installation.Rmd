You can install the released version of goodpress from its GitHub repository:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("maelle/goodpress", ref = "main")
```

Then you will need to tweaks things **once** on your website for three aspects

* Authentication (this is **compulsory**)
* Syntax highlighting (if you want to show R code in your posts)
* Math (if you want to show math in your posts)

See `vignette("setup", package = "goodpress")`.
