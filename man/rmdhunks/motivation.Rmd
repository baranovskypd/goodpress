The current best tool for writing from R Markdown to WordPress, [`knitr::knit2wp()`](https://tobiasdienlin.com/2019/03/08/how-to-publish-a-blog-post-on-wordpress-using-rmarkdown/), relies on a package that hasn't been updated in years and that depends on the no longer recommended [`RCurl`](https://frie.codes/curl-vs-rcurl/) and `XML`.
In the meantime, WordPress gained a [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) that to my knowledge isn't wrapped in any [working R package](https://github.com/jaredlander/wordpressr).

There is also the solution to [use a plug-in to sync a GitHub repo with a WordPress blog](https://github.com/mAAdhaTTah/wordpress-github-sync/) (see [this website](https://abcdr.thinkr.fr/soumettre-un-article/) and [its source](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/abcdR)) but it doesn't handle media.
If you use a GitHub repo:

* You could set up something like a GitHub Action workflow that'd interact with WordPress REST API each time you push to the default branch.
* Are you still sure you don't want to use a [static website generator instead](https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/)? :wink: More seriously, I am interested in blogging workflows so feel free to tell me why and how you use WordPress (in an issue for instance).
